# Function-Approximation-by-Neural-Networks

In this project, we attempt to implement a fully-connected feedforward neural network to approximate a sinusoidal function.

We found out that the with 1 hidden layer of 3 neurons, the approximation was poor as the model is underfitting. Yet, with an extra neuron (4 neurons), we successfully fitted the function.

Finally, we tried to overparametrize the model with 5-30 neurons and realized that there is no overfitting problem, which sounds counter-intuitive.

It shows that neural network is a robust and versatile learning method as it selects the 'right' features to learn instead of 'memorizing' all the training data, which explains its success in AI development these days.
